# COMS4032A - Applications of Algorithms 

## Assignment Work

### Assignment 1: [Assignment 1 PDF](./Assignment%201/Assignment1.pdf)
 To run all algorithms and measure their runtimes:
```bash
g++ measure_runtime.cpp smm_algorithms.cpp -o measure_time
./measure_time
```

To run the correctness check file:
```bash
g++ correctness_check.cpp smm_algorithms.cpp -o check
./check
```

### Assignment 2: [Assignment 2 PDF](./Assignment%202/Assignment2.pdf)
To run the Algorithms for part A:
```bash
g++ part_A_run.cpp -o runA
./runA
```

To run the Algorithms for part B:
```bash
g++ part_B_run.cpp -o runB
./runB
```

To run the correctness check for part B:
```bash
g++ correctness_check_partB.cpp -o checkB
./checkB
```
